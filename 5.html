    <p>The Kedartal trek is for those who have a love for adventure. It is a difficult trek, but it is well worth the effort. The trek climbs up to the glacial Kedartal lake, which sits amid a cauldron of big mountains.

        Famous mountains of our country rise in front of you in this cauldron, including Mt. Thalaysagar, Mt. Bhrigupanth, Manda Parvat, and Mt. Jogin 1, Mt Jogin 2. You will camp in the shadow of the mighty Mt. Thalaysagar and Mt. Bhrigupanth. The Thalaysagar peak can be seen perfectly in the reflection of the emerald-coloured waters of the Kedartal Lake. It is a remote, challenging trail that offers trekkers a measure of solitude in comparison to other, more crowded trails.
        
        The trail climbs to an altitude of 15,580 ft in just a few days, presenting trekkers with steep ascents and descents on tricky terrain as the journey includes hiking along a narrow ledge with a 60-degree incline. This can be not easy to manage while also trying to catch your breath at high altitudes, so you need to be in good physical and mental shape before attempting the Kedartal trek. 
        
        With no human habitation at such high altitudes and very few other trekkers on the trail, youâ€™ll feel like you have the whole mountain to yourself. You will be rewarded with beautiful views of the bhoj forest and high-altitude meadows. The trail to Kedartal is rocky with some difficult sections like the spider wall and requires trekkers to be careful where they step, but the views along the way are well worth the effort.
        
        The serene Kedartal lake is a sight to behold, and trekkers who complete the trek feel a sense of accomplishment.
